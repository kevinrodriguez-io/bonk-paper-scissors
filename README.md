# README

Bonk - Paper - Scissors or BPS is one of the first implementations of hashing-based commit-hash to reveal and fully on-chain game which is fully PVP, burning the base token in the process, by making BPS, we want to create a community of players who thrive in a fun game where they can stake their tokens and the winner takes it all.
Not only this implementation allows for future reveal-like card games, but it settles itself on a fun and free community.
